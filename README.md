### Background
I've been having difficulty getting the
[TDA package on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDA/index.html) to work with
large datasets. I am creating this repo to generate Dionysus compatible. This is a repo
that contains the code for generating / converting samples to run in either
[Dionysus](https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/) or [GUDHI](http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/).

For now this repo will focus on getting a variety of samples into the format of 
[Dense Cubical Grids](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/nanda/perseus/index.html)
